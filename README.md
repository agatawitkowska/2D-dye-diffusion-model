This model was developed by Agata Witkowska for the study
Witkowska A. & Jahn R., Biophysical Journal (2017)
"Rapid SNARE-mediated fusion of liposomes and chromaffin granules with giant unilamellar vesicles"
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2017.03.010

This is a simulation of labelled lipid diffusion in the membrane upon fusion of a vesicle containing such labelled lipid.
Additional details are provided in the accompanying .pdf file.
It runs with Matlab and GNU Octave
Required GNU Octave packages: statistics.
